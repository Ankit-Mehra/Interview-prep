**Describe a time you had a conflict in the workplace. What was the situation and how was it resolved? *(Ensure you end positively, noting what you learned from the experience)***

**Situation:** In my role as a Software Developer at Unity Health Toronto, I was part of the team developing an Identity Management application. We had daily scrum meetings to discuss progress and challenges.

**Task:** I noticed a challenge when one of my co-workers consistently talked over me and dismissed my contributions. This not only impacted my ability to contribute effectively but also the overall team dynamics.

**Action:** Recognizing the importance of clear and respectful communication, especially in a diverse and collaborative environment like Siemens values, I decided to address the issue directly yet diplomatically. I requested a private meeting with my colleague to express my feelings about being overlooked and to understand their perspective. I approached the conversation with empathy, aiming for a constructive outcome. I also sought advice from my team lead, who encouraged open dialogue to resolve team conflicts.

**Result:** The conversation was a turning point. My colleague was receptive to my concerns, apologized for any unintended dismissal, and expressed appreciation for my courage in bringing the issue to light. This not only improved our working relationship, turning them into a supportive mentor for the remainder of my internship but also enhanced the productivity and inclusiveness of our scrum meetings. This experience underscored the value of clear, empathetic communication and directly addressing conflicts in fostering a collaborative and respectful workplace. It's a lesson I plan to bring to Siemens, knowing the company's emphasis on effective communication across all levels and departments.

**What are your top 3 skills related to the job? *(Choose at minimum one technical skill to focus on out of your 3)***

Given the context of a job application to Siemens EDA as a Software Developer with a focus on Python, my top three skills related to the job are:

1. **Python Programming (Technical Skill):** Python is my strongest technical skill, honed through both academic projects and real-world applications. At Unity Health Toronto, I developed an Identity Management application using Python, which significantly improved administrative processes for hospital staff. My GitHub repository further showcases my proficiency in Python through various projects, including a machine learning pipeline for diabetes prediction and a web scraping tool for a small business client. My ability to leverage Python for complex data analysis, automation, and developing scalable applications aligns well with the requirements of developing chip design software at Siemens EDA.
2. **Problem-Solving:** My role as a software developer has always required a strong aptitude for problem-solving, a skill that I've continually refined throughout my career. For instance, during my internship at CAAT Pension Plan, I identified and resolved a significant issue with Azure AD B2C custom policy, enabling thousands of users to change their MFA preferences seamlessly. This capability to analyze, debug, and provide effective solutions is crucial for the development and optimization of Siemens EDA's software solutions.
3. **Collaboration and Communication:** Effective collaboration and clear communication are paramount in software development, especially when working on complex projects with interdisciplinary teams. My experience working in diverse team settings has equipped me with the ability to clearly articulate ideas, listen to team members, and adapt based on feedback. During my time at WIMTACH Centennial College, I collaborated closely with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to develop a machine learning pipeline for diabetes prediction, ensuring the project's success through effective communication and teamwork.

These skills, combined with my passion for technology and continuous learning, make me confident in my ability to contribute to the innovative projects at Siemens EDA.

**Tell us about a project that you finished recently that you are proud of?**

One project I'm particularly proud of involved building a RAG architecture pipeline, utilizing the llamaindex library for efficient data retrieval and document indexing. This project aimed to enhance our capabilities in generating accurate, context-aware responses for a complex query system, which is crucial for the analytical tasks we undertake.

The core of the project was to leverage the RAG model to combine the power of a retriever and a generator for producing highly relevant text generation outputs. I utilized Python extensively for scripting the entire pipeline, demonstrating my proficiency with the language and my ability to implement complex algorithms effectively.

A significant part of this project involved deploying the pipeline on Azure as an API server, securely tucked behind Azure API Management. This not only ensured scalable access to the service but also enabled strict security and governance over the API endpoints. The deployment process required careful consideration of performance and security best practices, which were meticulously adhered to.

Furthermore, the integration of Pinecone for vector search operations added another layer of sophistication to our solution, enabling us to perform similarity search at scale with minimal latency. This was critical for improving the efficiency and accuracy of our retriever component in the RAG architecture.

The successful deployment of this project on Azure demonstrated my ability to navigate complex cloud environments and leverage them for deploying advanced machine learning models. The project was a testament to my skills in Python programming, my understanding of modern AI architectures, and my capability to work with cutting-edge technologies in a cloud environment.

I believe this experience aligns well with Siemens EDA's focus on innovation and the development of advanced software solutions for chip design and verification. It showcases my technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and my ability to deliver complex projects that could contribute significantly to the pioneering work at Siemens EDA.

**Describe a time you had to troubleshoot a complex technical issue. What was the issue and how did you resolve it?**

**Situation:** In my role, I was tasked with enhancing our authentication and user management system, with a particular focus on improving both efficiency and security measures. We encountered a complex issue where our existing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method was not dynamic i.e there was no way for the user to change his MFA method.

**Task:** The challenge was to refine our Azure B2C custom policies to automatically reset the MFA method based on the presence of this new attribute. This required a deep understanding of Azure’s identity management capabilities and a creative approach to policy configuration.

**Action:** I meticulously reconfigured our Azure B2C custom policies to address this issue. This involved programming dynamic API endpoints to manage user attributes more effectively, allowing attributes to be set to both true and false values seamlessly within the Azure environment. I also developed a user-friendly front-end UI for administrators, enabling them to efficiently manage authentication methods and user details. This approach not only aimed at resolving the immediate technical challenge but also at enhancing the overall security and user experience of our system.

**Result:** The project was a success, resulting in a significant improvement in our authentication system's efficiency and security. The automatic reset of MFA methods based on specific user attributes introduced a level of proactivity in our security measures that we had not achieved before. Furthermore, the flexibility for users to change their phone authentication method seamlessly improved user satisfaction and trust in our system. By empowering administrators with better tools for managing user attributes and authentication methods, we streamlined operations and elevated our security protocols. This project was a testament to the importance of innovative problem-solving in technical troubleshooting and had a profound impact on our system’s functionality and security.
