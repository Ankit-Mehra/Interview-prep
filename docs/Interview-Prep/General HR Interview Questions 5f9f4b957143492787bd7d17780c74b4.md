**Describe a time you had a conflict in the workplace. What was the situation and how was it resolved? *(Ensure you end positively, noting what you learned from the experience)***

During my internship at Unity Health, I was working on an important Identity Management application. However, I encountered a conflict with one of my colleagues during our daily scrum meetings. They often talked over me and dismissed my ideas as inexperienced, which left me feeling frustrated and undervalued.

I discussed the issue with my team lead, who advised me to have an honest conversation with my colleague. I mustered the courage to talk to them, and they were surprisingly receptive. They acknowledged their behavior, and we developed a healthier working relationship.

As a result, collaboration improved, and the daily scrum meetings became more inclusive and productive. My colleague even became a supportive mentor during my internship.

This experience taught me the importance of open communication in resolving conflicts and fostering a positive workplace. I've carried this lesson with me, valuing empathy and effective communication in all my interactions.

**Provide an example where you had to work in a collaborative team setting. What were some of the challenges you experienced?**

I am working with an agile team of 10 developers at CAAT pension plan for their Employer Portal. and before this I have worked with 15 developers at Ceridian.

Some of the challenges that I faced were.

- Every team member is a different person with a different mindset and capabilities. While diversity is a strength, it sometimes led to misunderstandings and demotivation. The best way to address this is open and honest communication during team meetings and one-on-one discussions. By actively listening to team members' concerns and ideas, we can collaboratively find solutions and make everyone feel heard and valued.
- Another challenge was maintaining focus and productivity throughout the project. To keep the team on track, we adopted Jira as our project management tool, allowing us to set clear goals, track progress, and identify potential bottlenecks. This helped us maintain our energy level and ensured that we didn't lose sight of the project's objectives.
- Moreover, working in a multinational team introduced time zone differences, which sometimes affected collaboration and response times. To overcome this, I realized the importance of clear and concise writing in our communication channels. By providing well-structured and detailed updates, we reduced misunderstandings and saved valuable time.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to the Office of the Chief Information Office's initiatives and leveraging this role to propel my career towards new heights.

**What is an area of professional development for you (an area you need to grow more)? *(Choose something that does not directly impact your ability to perform the core function of the job)***

I am interested in the field of Software Development and Cloud technologies. And I think RBC will be a perfect place to hone these skills.

**Describe a time you had to troubleshoot a complex technical issue. What was the issue and how did you resolve it?**

In the field of software engineering, you must have a hacker mentality. First, you should be able to define an exact problem and then you can search the topic on forums like stack overflow, geek for geeks, W3schools, etc. So, I had a project assignment for school which included making a bug smasher game. so, need to have a background, and in that background, there is a bug that keeps on hooping on it and the user should smash that bug. So, it was a challenging assignment because the course syllabus did not teach us to do that. so went ahead and searched the internet and I found that HTML has a canvas tag in which you could make some 2D graphics. so went and watched some videos about canvas on YouTube learned whom it worked, and I was successfully able to build that game.

During my internship at Ceridian, I was tasked with streamlining a codebase cleanup initiative, primarily focusing on redundant SQL procedure files. Collaborating with a senior engineer, we decided to create an app using WPF to identify references within .cs and SQL files. The app generated a text file listing references.

Realizing the manual effort needed to sift through these references, I researched and implemented a PowerShell script to automate decision-making. This script categorized files as either in use or unused, simplifying the process significantly.

The final step involved deleting the unused files from TFS, a task prone to manual errors. To address this, I developed another PowerShell script that not only removed the files from TFS but also efficiently moved them to the pending delete tab.

In summary, my approach involved creating an app for reference identification, a PowerShell script for automated decision-making, and another script for the seamless deletion of unused files, providing a comprehensive and efficient solution to the codebase cleanup.

**Tell us about a project that you finished recently that you are proud of?**

Absolutely, I’m excited to share a recent project that holds a lot of personal pride for me. This project revolved around enhancing our authentication and user management system, with the overarching goal of improving efficiency and security.

One of the key accomplishments I'd like to highlight is the refinement of our Azure B2C custom policies. I meticulously configured these policies to cater to a newly introduced user attribute. What makes this particularly significant is that we harnessed these policies to automatically reset a user's Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method as soon as this specific attribute was identified. This brought an element of proactivity to enhancing security, which aligns well with our continuous improvement efforts.

Expanding on this, I extended the same principle to facilitate the seamless change of a user's phone authentication method. This flexibility was a welcome addition to our authentication workflows, allowing us to cater to diverse user preferences.

A pivotal role in the project was played by the dynamic API endpoints I developed for managing user attributes. These endpoints granted us the ability to set attributes to both true and false values within the Azure environment. This newfound customization not only streamlined our user management processes but also empowered us to adapt our approach based on specific needs.

Furthermore, I took the initiative to design and develop a user-friendly front-end UI. This interface is geared towards administrators, empowering them to efficiently reset authentication methods and phone numbers for users. This proactive approach to system management not only saves time but also elevates our security protocols.

These combined efforts had a profound impact on our authentication and user management system. By offering more control over user attributes and empowering administrators with intuitive tools, we're well-equipped to cater to user needs and ensure a secure experience.

**What are your strengths and weakness?**

- I am a learner I believe in the concept of “learn, unlearn, and relearn”.
- Team Player
- Strive for perfection.

Weakness

- I get caught up in a single problem sometimes and get frustrated if I am not able to solve it. But with time I have realized no matter how much I think that this problem is almost impossible to solve or too hard for me to solve. If I remain positive and persistent I most of the time do get to a solution. And walking away from your computer screen and just getting engaged in a walk or simple household chores does help.

**Describe a time you made a mistake at work. What was the situation and how did you fix it? *(Ensure you end positively, noting what you learned from the experience).***

Before I started my career as a software developer, I was working as an Assistant Commandant in one of the Paramilitary forces in India, I was doing an in-service course, and I was giving a presentation about security threats but in some of the points that I presented I made some assumptions and there this was a gentleman who knew much about the subject but he was kind enough not point out during the presentation. Later, he told me where I was wrong and what are facts. So, I learned two things that day never assume and research well before delivering in front of an audience, and secondly, until there is some dire situation if someone is wrong it is best not to interrupt him but rather correct him privately so that will be much more helpful and impactful.
