# SQL Interview Questions

**1. What is SQL, and what is its primary purpose?**

**Answer:** SQL (Structured Query Language) is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational database systems. Its primary purpose is to perform operations on structured data stored in databases. SQL enables users to perform tasks such as querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, as well as defining and managing database schemas.

**2. Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.**

**Answer:** SQL and NoSQL databases are two different types of database management systems:

- **SQL (Relational Databases):**
    - SQL databases use a structured schema to define the structure of data tables and relationships between them.
    - Data is stored in tables with rows and columns, enforcing data integrity through constraints.
    - SQL databases are suitable for structured and well-defined data.
    - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
- **NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases):**
    - NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, allowing for flexible and dynamic data models.
    - They can handle unstructured, semi-structured, or highly variable data.
    - NoSQL databases are suitable for scenarios where data structures may change frequently.
    - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

**3. What are the main components of an SQL query?**

**Answer:** An SQL query typically consists of the following components:

- **SELECT:** Specifies the columns to be retrieved from the database.
- **FROM:** Specifies the table(s) from which to retrieve data.
- **WHERE:** Filters the rows based on a condition.
- **GROUP BY:** Groups rows with identical values into summary rows.
- **HAVING:** Filters grouped rows based on a condition.
- **ORDER BY:** Sorts the result set by one or more columns.
- **LIMIT/OFFSET:** Restricts the number of rows returned (often used for pagination).

**4. What is a database schema, and why is it important?**

**Answer:** A database schema is a logical container that organizes database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and relationships. It defines the structure and organization of data within a database. The schema is important because it:

- Enforces data integrity by defining constraints and relationships.
- Provides a blueprint for data organization, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- Separates database objects into logical namespaces, preventing naming conflicts.
- Enhances security by controlling access to specific schema objects.

**5. Define the terms "table," "row," and "column" in the context of a database.**

**Answer:**

- **Table:** In a database, a table is a structured collection of data organized into rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or data type, and it defines the structure of the data, including the names and data types of its columns.
- **Row:** A row, also known as a record or tuple, is a single entry or instance of data within a table. Each row contains values for each column, representing a complete set of information related to a particular entity or record.
- **Column:** A column is a vertical arrangement of data within a table. It represents a specific attribute or property of the data. Columns have names and data types that define the kind of information they can store, such as integers, text, or dates.

**Examples:**

Consider a "Students" table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);
```

- "Students" is the table name.
- Each row represents a student record.
- Columns: StudentID, FirstName, LastName, and Age represent specific attributes of each student.

These answers provide a fundamental understanding of SQL concepts and terminology. SQL is a versatile language used for working with relational databases, and mastering these basics is crucial for effective database management and querying.

**6. Write an SQL query to retrieve all records from a table named "Employees."**

**Answer:** To retrieve all records from the "Employees" table, you can use a simple `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees;
```

This query selects all columns (`*`) from the "Employees" table.

**7. How do you select distinct values from a column in SQL?**

**Answer:** To select distinct values from a column in SQL, you can use the `DISTINCT` keyword in a `SELECT` statement. For example, if you want to retrieve distinct values from the "City" column in a "Customers" table:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT City FROM Customers;
```

This query returns a list of unique values in the "City" column.

**8. Explain the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses in SQL.**

**Answer:** The `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses are used for filtering rows in SQL, but they serve different purposes:

- **WHERE Clause:** The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows before any grouping is done (typically with the `SELECT` statement). It filters rows based on conditions applied to individual rows or columns.
    
    Example:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate > '2023-01-01';
    ```
    
- **HAVING Clause:** The `HAVING` clause is used to filter rows after the grouping of data (typically with the `GROUP BY` statement). It filters rows based on conditions applied to groups of rows, often used with aggregate functions.
    
    Example:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) as OrderCount
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
    ```
    

In summary, `WHERE` filters individual rows, while `HAVING` filters groups of rows after grouping operations.

**9. Write an SQL query to sort records in a table by a specific column in descending order.**

**Answer:** To sort records in descending order based on a specific column, use the `ORDER BY` clause with the `DESC` keyword. For example, to sort a "Products" table by the "Price" column in descending order:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products
ORDER BY Price DESC;
```

This query retrieves all columns from the "Products" table, and the results are sorted by the "Price" column in descending order.

**10. What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause in SQL?**

**Answer:** The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL is used to group rows with identical values in one or more columns into summary rows. It is primarily used in conjunction with aggregate functions to perform calculations on groups of data. The primary purposes of the `GROUP BY` clause are:

- Aggregating data: You can calculate summaries like counts, sums, averages, and more for each group of rows.
- Data analysis: It allows you to analyze data based on specific attributes or categories.
- Data presentation: Grouping data can help organize and present information in a structured format.

Example:

```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) as AvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

This query groups employees by their department and calculates the average salary for each department.

These answers provide detailed explanations and examples for SQL querying concepts, including selecting data, filtering rows, sorting results, and using the `GROUP BY` clause for data aggregation. SQL queries are fundamental to retrieving and manipulating data from relational databases effectively.

**11. What are inner joins and outer joins in SQL? Provide examples.**

[SQL Joins (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp)

In SQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There are different types of joins, with inner joins and outer joins being the most common.

1. **Inner Join:**
An inner join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables. The result set contains only the rows where the specified condition is true.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT
        employees.employee_id,
        employees.employee_name,
        departments.department_name
    FROM
        employees
    INNER JOIN
        departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    ```
    
    In this example, the `INNER JOIN` keyword is used to retrieve records where there is a match in the `department_id` column between the `employees` and `departments` tables.
    
2. **Left Outer Join (or Left Join):**
A left outer join returns all the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT
        employees.employee_id,
        employees.employee_name,
        departments.department_name
    FROM
        employees
    LEFT JOIN
        departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    ```
    
    This query retrieves all records from the `employees` table and the matching records from the `departments` table. If there is no matching department for an employee, the columns from the `departments` table will contain NULL.
    
3. **Right Outer Join (or Right Join):**
A right outer join is similar to a left outer join but returns all the rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT
        employees.employee_id,
        employees.employee_name,
        departments.department_name
    FROM
        employees
    RIGHT JOIN
        departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    ```
    
    This query retrieves all records from the `departments` table and the matching records from the `employees` table. If there is no matching employee for a department, the columns from the `employees` table will contain NULL.
    
4. **Full Outer Join:**
A full outer join returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT
        employees.employee_id,
        employees.employee_name,
        departments.department_name
    FROM
        employees
    FULL OUTER JOIN
        departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    ```
    
    This query retrieves all records from both the `employees` and `departments` tables. If there is no matching department for an employee or no matching employee for a department, the columns from the respective table will contain NULL. Note that some database systems may not support the `FULL OUTER JOIN` syntax directly, and you may need to use a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN` to achieve the same result.

**12. Explain the difference between a primary key and a foreign key.**

Primary keys and foreign keys are essential concepts in database design:

**Primary Key:**

- A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table.
- It enforces the uniqueness constraint, ensuring that no two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.
- Primary keys are used to uniquely identify records and create relationships between tables.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);
```

In this example, **`employee_id`** is the primary key of the **`employees`** table. It ensures that each employee has a unique identifier, and no two employees can have the same **`employee_id`**. This field is used to uniquely identify each record in the **`employees`** table.

**Foreign Key:**

- A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
- It establishes relationships between tables, defining dependencies and enforcing referential integrity.
- Foreign keys ensure that values in the referring table match values in the referenced table's primary key.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

In this example, the **`departments`** table has a primary key called **`department_id`**. The **`employees`** table has a foreign key called **`department_id`**, which references the primary key of the **`departments`** table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables, ensuring that any value in the **`department_id`** column of the **`employees`** table must exist in the **`department_id`** column of the **`departments`** table.

**13. Write an SQL query to retrieve data from two related tables using an INNER JOIN.**

**Answer:** Let's assume we have two tables, "Orders" and "Customers," and they are related by the "CustomerID" column. To retrieve a list of orders along with the customer names using an INNER JOIN:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

This query combines data from both tables where there is a match between "CustomerID" in the "Orders" table and "CustomerID" in the "Customers" table.

**14. What is a self-join, and when would you use it?**

**Answer:** A self-join is a type of join where a table is joined with itself. It is used when you have a table with a hierarchical or recursive relationship, such as an organizational chart or a tree structure.

**Example:** Suppose you have an "Employees" table with a "ManagerID" column representing the manager of each employee. To find the names of employees along with the names of their managers:

```sql
SELECT E.EmployeeName, M.EmployeeName AS ManagerName
FROM Employees E
LEFT JOIN Employees M ON E.ManagerID = M.EmployeeID;

```

In this self-join example, we join the "Employees" table with itself, using aliases (`E` and `M`) to distinguish between the employee and manager records.

**15. Describe the concept of a one-to-many relationship in database design.**

In database design, a one-to-many (1:N) relationship is a type of relationship between two tables where one record in the first table can be associated with multiple records in the second table, but each record in the second table is associated with only one record in the first table. This is one of the most common types of relationships in relational database modeling.

**Example:**

Let's consider a scenario where we have two tables: `departments` and `employees`. Each department can have multiple employees, but each employee belongs to only one department.

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);

```

In this example:

- The `departments` table contains information about different departments in an organization.
    - `department_id` is the primary key, uniquely identifying each department.
    - `department_name` stores the name of the department.
- The `employees` table contains information about individual employees.
    - `employee_id` is the primary key, uniquely identifying each employee.
    - `employee_name` stores the name of the employee.
    - `department_id` is a foreign key referencing the `department_id` in the `departments` table. This establishes a link between the two tables, indicating the department to which each employee belongs.

With this design:

- Each record in the `departments` table (e.g., a specific department) can be associated with multiple records in the `employees` table, as multiple employees can belong to the same department.
- However, each record in the `employees` table is associated with only one record in the `departments` table, as each employee belongs to only one department.

This represents a one-to-many relationship: one department has many employees, but each employee belongs to one department. This type of relationship is fundamental in organizing and modeling data in relational databases.

1. Describe with example the concept of a many-to-many relationship in database design.

In database design, a many-to-many (M:N) relationship is a type of relationship between two tables where each record in the first table can be associated with multiple records in the second table, and vice versa. This type of relationship is common and is typically resolved by introducing an intermediate table, often called a junction or associative table, to manage the associations.

**Example:**

Consider a scenario where you have two tables: `students` and `courses`. A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);

```

In this example:

- The `students` table contains information about individual students.
    - `student_id` is the primary key, uniquely identifying each student.
    - `student_name` stores the name of the student.
- The `courses` table contains information about different courses.
    - `course_id` is the primary key, uniquely identifying each course.
    - `course_name` stores the name of the course.
- The `enrollments` table serves as the junction table, managing the many-to-many relationship between students and courses.
    - `enrollment_id` is the primary key for this table.
    - `student_id` is a foreign key referencing the `student_id` in the `students` table.
    - `course_id` is a foreign key referencing the `course_id` in the `courses` table.

With this design:

- Each record in the `students` table can be associated with multiple records in the `enrollments` table, indicating the courses in which the student is enrolled.
- Similarly, each record in the `courses` table can be associated with multiple records in the `enrollments` table, indicating the students enrolled in that course.

This resolves the many-to-many relationship by introducing the `enrollments` table, which captures the associations between students and courses. In this way, you can represent the complexity of the relationship in a relational database structure.

1. Describe in detail types of relationship in database design with example.

In database design, relationships define how data in different tables is related to each other. There are several types of relationships, each serving a specific purpose. Let's explore these types of relationships in detail, along with examples:

**1. One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:**

- In a one-to-one relationship, each record in the first table is associated with only one record in the second table, and vice versa.
- This type of relationship is rare in practice but is useful when you need to split a table with many columns into two for better organization.

**Example:** Consider a "Person" table and a "Passport" table. Each person can have only one passport, and each passport is associated with only one person.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Person (
    PersonID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Passport (
    PassportID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    PassportNumber VARCHAR(20),
    PersonID INT UNIQUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Person(PersonID)
);

```

**2. One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:**

- In a one-to-many relationship, each record in the first table is associated with one or more records in the second table, but each record in the second table is associated with only one record in the first table.
- This is the most common type of relationship in database design.

**Example:** Consider a "Customer" table and an "Order" table. Each customer can place multiple orders, but each order is associated with only one customer.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Order (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    OrderDate DATE,
    CustomerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customer(CustomerID)
);
```

**3. Many-to-One (N:1) Relationship:**

- In a many-to-one relationship, many records in the first table are associated with one record in the second table.
- This relationship is essentially the reverse of a one-to-many relationship.

**Example:** Continuing with the "Customer" and "Order" tables, this time consider the perspective of orders. Many orders are placed by one customer.

**4. Many-to-Many (N:N) Relationship:**

- In a many-to-many relationship, many records in the first table can be associated with many records in the second table.
- This type of relationship requires a junction table, often referred to as a bridge table or linking table, to connect the two tables.

**Example:** Consider a "Student" table and a "Course" table. Each student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    StudentName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CourseName VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE StudentCourse (
    StudentID INT,
    CourseID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (StudentID, CourseID),
    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Student(StudentID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CourseID) REFERENCES Course(CourseID)
);
```

**5. Self-Referencing Relationship:**

- A self-referencing relationship occurs when a table is related to itself, often used to represent hierarchical or recursive data.

**Example:** Consider an "Employee" table with an "EmployeeID" and a "ManagerID." Each employee reports to another employee, and the manager is also an employee within the same table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    ManagerID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ManagerID) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID)
);

```

These are the common types of relationships in database design, each serving specific data modeling requirements. Understanding and properly defining relationships between tables is essential for creating well-structured and efficient databases that accurately represent real-world scenarios.

1. What are stored procedures and triggers in SQL? How do they differ from regular SQL queries? Explain using examples.

Stored procedures and triggers are database objects used to execute predefined actions or operations in response to specific events or as part of routine database management tasks. They differ from regular SQL queries in their purpose, structure, and when and how they are executed.

**Stored Procedures:**
Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements or queries that are saved in the database and can be executed repeatedly as a single unit. They are primarily used for encapsulating a set of SQL statements into a reusable programmatic entity. Stored procedures offer several advantages, including improved security, performance, and code modularity.

**Example of a Stored Procedure:**
Let's create a simple stored procedure in SQL that inserts a new customer record into a "Customers" table:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE InsertCustomer
    @FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    @LastName VARCHAR(50),
    @Email VARCHAR(100)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Customers (FirstName, LastName, Email)
    VALUES (@FirstName, @LastName, @Email);
END;
```

To execute this stored procedure:

```sql
EXEC InsertCustomer 'John', 'Doe', 'johndoe@example.com';
```

**Triggers:**
Triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific events or actions in the database. These events can include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or other data manipulation operations on a table. Triggers are useful for enforcing business rules, maintaining data integrity, or logging changes.

**Example of a Trigger:**
Let's create a trigger in SQL that logs every INSERT operation on an "Orders" table into an "OrderLog" table:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER OrderInsertLog
ON Orders
AFTER INSERT
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO OrderLog (OrderID, LogDate, LogMessage)
    SELECT OrderID, GETDATE(), 'New order inserted'
    FROM inserted;
END;
```

In this example, the trigger "OrderInsertLog" fires after an INSERT operation on the "Orders" table and logs the event into the "OrderLog" table.

**Differences from Regular SQL Queries:**

1. **Purpose:**
    - Regular SQL queries are used for retrieving, modifying, or deleting data from the database.
    - Stored procedures are used for encapsulating a series of SQL statements for reuse and improved code organization.
    - Triggers are used to automatically respond to specific database events, such as data changes.
2. **Execution Control:**
    - Regular SQL queries are executed explicitly by the user or application.
    - Stored procedures are executed explicitly by calling them using a specific command.
    - Triggers are executed implicitly in response to predefined events, such as data modifications.
3. **Usage:**
    - Regular SQL queries are used for ad-hoc querying and data manipulation.
    - Stored procedures are used for encapsulating business logic, ensuring consistency, and enhancing code reusability.
    - Triggers are used for enforcing data integrity, auditing changes, and automating actions in response to events.
4. **Location:**
    - Regular SQL queries are typically part of application code and sent to the database when needed.
    - Stored procedures are stored in the database itself.
    - Triggers are also stored in the database and associated with specific tables.

In summary, stored procedures and triggers in SQL provide a way to encapsulate and automate database operations and actions. While regular SQL queries are essential for direct data manipulation, stored procedures and triggers add a layer of programmability and automation to database management.
